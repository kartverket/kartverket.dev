# Functions
Businessfunctions describe what Kartverket does to deliver on its responsibilities.
The systems we in Kartverket develop and operate contribute to one or more functions, and different functions may have different requirements for availability and uptime. A function is realized through systems, components and teams that together deliver functionality. By connecting functions to the teams' systems, we get a better overview of who delivers what, what dependencies exist, and what is affected if something is unavailable. Functions are organized in a hierarchy. Smaller sub-functions build up larger functions, so that we can see the connection between details and the whole.

The diagram below shows a function with two sub-functions and the teams and systems associated with them.

# Why do we have functions in Kartverket.dev?
Kartverket.dev is based on Backstage, where systems, components and teams, among other things, have already been modeled.
Functions is an extension created by the Kartverket to link together: 
- the systems we operate 
- The teams that deliver them 
- the business requirements we must meet 
This makes it easier to understand how technical solutions are related to what the Norwegian Mapping Authority actually delivers to society.

# How to create a function?
1. Go to the Functions tab 
2. Select Create New Functions 
3. Fill in: 
    - which systems the function depends on 
    - Which team owns the function 
    
Once the change has been added to the "funksjonsregister"-repository, the function will be visible in the kartverket.dev. There, you can later add relevant forms such as service level forms.


# Forms
Functions have associated forms about e.g. service level. To read more about forms, you can search for regular forms on confluence
